This repository provides a convenient and efficient starting point for developing applications using React, Vite, and TypeScript.

## Features ðŸ“Š

This template is designed with productivity and ease of use in mind. It includes:

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite:** A next-generation frontend tooling that significantly improves the frontend development experience.

The project structure is organized and intuitive, making it easy for developers to navigate and add their code. The template includes:
